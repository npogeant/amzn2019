# Amazon Stock vs Twitter 2019

This projet is basically looking to analyse tweets and try to link to the financial markets. It got a sentiment analysis from a pretrained model specialized with financial data.

## The data (tweets scrapped)

The data look are tweets for the entire year of 2019 with the keyword $AMZN.

## Analysis

The jupyter notebook "Main_Analysis_AMZN.ipynb" in the repository is a large part of the analysis from the descriptive one to the opinion mining.

I also wrote an [article](https://npogeant.medium.com/the-amazon-stock-vs-twitter-in-2019-931c88831fc1) on medium explaning with details the analysis from the beginning and using stock market data to observe results.

Some of the scripts I used are in the Scripts folder.
